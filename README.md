use Timer to trigger your devices

Platform for Animal Observation and Manipulation 

An efficient system to monitor animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Being compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection leading to long lasting collection periods
-	Being applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	Increasing the observation quality via decreasing the disturbance to the animals
