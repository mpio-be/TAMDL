It consists of the following components:
- Control.c - Sequence Control module.
- CfgData.c - Handling of configuration data.
- ExtInt.c - External interrupt handler.
- Keys.c - Key interrupt handling and translation.
- AlarmClock.c - Alarm clock and timers facility.
- DCF77.c - DCF77 Atomic Clock Decoder
- clock.c - An implementation of the POSIX time() function.
- LCD_DOGM162.c - Driver for the DOGM162 LC-Display.
- DisplayMenu.c - Display manager for Menus and LCD.
- DM_Clock_Transp.c - Display Module to show Clock and Transponder number
- DM_PowerOutput.c - Display Module to switch @ref Power_Outputs
- DM_BatteryStatus.c - Display Module to show current Battery Status
- DM_PowerTimes.c - Display Module to show all configured ON/OFF Times.
- RFID.c - RFID reader to receive transponder IDs.
- BatteryMon.c - Battery monitor, periodically reads the state of the
  battery via the SMBus.
- LEUART.c - The Low-Energy UART can be used as monitoring and debugging
  connection to a host computer.
- microsd.c - Together with the files "diskio.c" and "ff.c", this module
  provides an implementation of a FAT file system on the @ref SD_Card.
- Logging.c - Logging facility to send messages to the LEUART and store
  them into a file on the SD-Card.
- eeprom_emulation.c - Routines to store data in Flash, taken from AN0019.
