 * </table></center>
 *
 * @subsection ssa01 Microcontroller
 * The heart of the board is an EFM32G230 microcontroller.  It provides two
 * different clock domains: All low-energy peripheral is clocked via a
 * 32.768kHz external XTAL.  The MCU and other high performance peripheral
 * uses a high-frequency clock.  The board can be configured to use the
 * internal RC-oscillator, or an external 32MHz XTAL for that purpose,
 * see define @ref USE_EXT_32MHZ_CLOCK.
 *
 * @subsection EEPROM EEPROM
 * The last 8 KB of Flash memory are used for EEPROM emulation.  This area holds
 * persistent, board-specific data, e.g. the calibration values for calculating
 * voltage and current values during UA1 and UA2 measuring.
 *
 * @subsection DCF77_Atomic_Clock DCF77 Atomic Clock
 * When powered on, the DCF77 hardware module is enabled to receive the time
 * information and set the system clock.  During this phase, the Power-On LED
 * (i.e. LED1) shows the current state of the DCF signal.  The further behavior
 * depends on the settings in the <i>config.h</i> file.  If the define @ref
 * DCF77_ONCE_PER_DAY is 1, the receiver (and also the LED) will be switched
 * off after time has been synchronized.  As the name of the define suggests,
 * it will be switched on once per day.  To properly detect a change between
 * winter and summer time, i.e. <i>normal time</i> (MEZ) and <i>daylight saving
 * time</i> (MESZ), this happens at 01:55 for MEZ, and 02:55 for MESZ.<br>
 * If the define is 0, the receiver remains switched on, but the LED will only
 * get active again when the time signal gets out-of-sync.<br>
 *
 * @subsection RFID_Reader RFID Reader
 * The RFID reader is used to receive the transponder number of the bird.
 * The module can be configured as Short Range (SR) or Long Range (LR) reader
 * via configuration variable @ref RFID_TYPE.  The reader hardware is supplied
 * by one of the @ref Power_Outputs.  Use variable @ref RFID_POWER to select the
 * right one.  Be sure to verify the output voltage is correct, otherwise
 * the reader may be destroyed.<br>
 * The RFID reader is enabled by the ON-Times of the selected power output, and
 * disabled by the respective OFF-Times.  If a transponder ID has been detected,
 * it is displayed on the @ref LC_Display (if it is powered on at this time),
 * and logged to a file on the @ref SD_Card.  If configuration variable @ref
 * RFID_ABSENT_DETECT_TIMEOUT is set to a value greater than 0, the absence
 * detection is enabled, and another event will be logged after the transponder
 * cannot be seen (read) anymore, for the amount of time.
 *
 * @subsection Keys Keys (Push Buttons)
 * There exist 5 push buttons on the board:
 * - <b>RESET</b> performs a hardware reset on the board.
 * - <b>DOWN</b> selects the next display module.  This key provides autorepeat
 *   functionality, i.e. it is repeated when permanently asserted.
 * - <b>UP</b> selects the previous display module.  Autorepeat lets you
 *   effectively move through the menus in a fast way.
 * - <b>RIGHT</b> enters the next deeper level of sub-menus.
 * - <b>LEFT</b> leaves the current sub-menu and returns to the menu one level
 *   above.
 * - <b>SET</b> is used by some menus to trigger an action, e.g. to enable or
 *   disable a Power Output.  Asserting SET for more than 750ms exits the
 *   current menu, returns to the home screen and switches the LCD off.
 *
 * The duration how long the respective information is displayed before
 * switching the LCD off again, can be adjusted by the define @ref
 * LCD_POWER_OFF_TIMEOUT.
 *
 * @subsection LC_Display LC-Display
 * The display provides 2 lines รก 16 characters.  It is connected to the
 * EFM32 microcontroller via a parallel bus interface.  To save power, the
 * whole display usually is switched off and only activated by asserting a
 * push button or when exchanging the SD-Card.  However, after a power-up or
 * reset, the LCD remains powered on, until the system clock is synchronized
 * with the @ref DCF77_Atomic_Clock signal.  This allows the user to read the
 * firmware version, the free space on the SD-Card, and the log filename.
 *
 * The visual contrast of the LCD can be adjusted via @ref l_Contrast.
 *
 * @subsection ssa06 LEDs
 * There are two LEDs, one is red, the other one is green.
 * - The red LED is the Power-On LED.  It shows the current state of the
 *   DCF77 signal during receiving of the time information.  In normal
 *   condition the LED will be switched off.
 * - The green LED is the Log Flush LED.  It lights whenever there are write
 *   accesses to SD-Card.
 *
 * @subsection SD_Card SD-Card
 * The SD-Card is used to store configuration and logging data.  Only formatted
 * cards can be used, supported file systems are FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32.  The
 * filenames must follow the DOS schema 8+3, i.e. maximum 8 characters for
 * the basename, and 3 for the extension.  If the SD-Card contains a file
 * <b>BOX<i>nnnn</i>.TXT</b>, where <b><i>nnnn</i></b> can be any decimal
 * number, this will be used as the new log file.  In this way the filename
 * allows you to assign a specific box number to a dedicated unit.  If no
 * such file exists on the media, file "BOX0999.TXT" is created.
 * Another file on the SD-Card is <a href="../../CONFIG.TXT"><i>CONFIG.TXT</i></a>
 * which contains the configuration for the feeder.  Have a look at the example
 * configuration file for a description of all possible variables defined in
 * @ref l_CfgVarList.
 * - Removing an SD-Card
 *   -# Generate a log message by some action, e.g. with a transponder, or by
 *      asserting the <i>Set-Key</i> to force a LogFlush().
 *   -# Wait about 5 seconds (@ref LOG_SAMPLE_TIMEOUT) until the green LED
 *      lights.  If data exists in the log, this is written to the SD-Card now.
 *   -# When the green LED is off again, you have a guaranteed duration
 *      of 15 seconds (@ref LOG_FLUSH_PAUSE) where no further data will be
 *      written to the SD-Card.
 *   -# Remove the SD-Card within this time.  The message "SD-Card removed"
 *      will be displayed on the LCD for 10 seconds.  All newly generated log
 *      messages will be stored in memory until another media is available.
 *
 * - Inserting an SD-Card
 *   -# Just insert the SD-Card into the slot.  The message "SD-Card inserted"
 *      will be displayed on the LCD.
 *   -# The file system on the SD-Card will be mounted and the free space of
 *      the media is reported.
 *   -# If a firmware update file (*.UPD) exists on the SD-Card, a reboot will
 *      be initiated to pass control to the booter.
 *   -# Otherwise the firmware looks for a "BOX<n>.TXT" file to use as new log
 *      file.
 *
 * @subsection ssa08 Battery Monitor
 * The battery pack has its own controller.  It is connected to the EFM32
 * microcontroller via I2C-bus.  The battery monitor requests status
 * information from the battery pack and logs this on a regular basis, i.e.
 * at @ref ALARM_BAT_MON_TIME_1 and @ref ALARM_BAT_MON_TIME_2.
 *
 * @subsection Low_Energy_UART Low-Energy UART
 * The Low-Energy UART (LEUART) provides a connection to a host computer (PC).
 * It can be used as monitoring and debugging interface.  All log messages,
 * written to the SD-Card, are sent through this interface also.  This behaviour
 * can be changed by defining @ref LOG_MONITOR_FUNCTION to @ref NONE.
 * The format of this UART is 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity.
 *
 * @subsection Power_Outputs Power Outputs
 * There are 3 switchable power outputs:
 * - <b>UA1</b> from DC/DC converter IC3,
 * - <b>UA2</b> from DC/DC converter IC4, and
 * - <b>BATT</b> from BATT_INPUT via FET T4
 *
 * All of these outputs can be switched on or off at selectable times.  Up to
 * five <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> times can be defined via configuration
 * variables in file <a href="../../CONFIG.TXT"><i>CONFIG.TXT</i></a>:
 * - @ref UA1_ON_TIME_1
 * - @ref UA2_ON_TIME_1
 * - @ref BATT_ON_TIME_1
 *
 * If an additional Power Cycle Interval is specified for a power output,
 * it will be switched on and off during its activation times, according to
 * the values of the following configuration variables:
 * - @ref UA1_INTERVAL
 * - @ref UA2_INTERVAL
 * - @ref BATT_INTERVAL
 *
 * If the @ref RFID_Reader is configured for one of this outputs, it will
 * automatically be enabled or disabled together with the respective power
 * output.  When the absence detection is enabled via @ref
 * RFID_ABSENT_DETECT_TIMEOUT, disabling the RFID reader is deferred as long as
 * a transponder is still present.
 * @warning
 * If @ref RFID_ABSENT_DETECT_TIMEOUT is set to 0, Absence Detection is disabled
 * and the RFID reader and Power Output is immediately switched off!
 *
 * @subsection ssa11 Firmware
 * The firmware consists of an initialization part and a main loop, also called
 * service execution loop.  The initialization part sets up all modules, enables
 * devices and interrupts.  The service execution loop handles all tasks that
 * must not be executed in interrupt context.
 *
 * After power-up or reset the following actions are performed:
 * -# Basic initialization of MCU and clocks
 * -# Low-Energy UART is set up
 * -# LEDs are switched on for test purposes (lamp test)
 * -# The logging facility is initialized and the firmware version is logged
 * -# Further hardware initialization (Keys, DCF77, RFID reader,
 *    SD-Card interface, Interrupts, Alarm Clock)
 * -# The LC-Display is activated and the firmware version is shown
 * -# LEDs are switched off after 4 seconds
 * -# The Battery Monitor is initialized
 * -# The DCF77 Atomic Clock is enabled to receive the time signal
 *
 * The program then enters the Service Execution Loop which takes care of:
 * - Power management for the RFID reader
 * - Power management for the LC-Display
 * - SD-Card change detection and re-mounting of the filesystem
 * - Reading the configuration file CONFIG.TXT from the SD-Card and set-up
 *   the related functionality
 * - Battery monitoring
 * - Writing the log buffer to the SD-Card
 * - Entering the right energy mode
 *
 * @section cfg Configuration Variables
 * The behaviour of the system can be changed by setting configuration
 * variables in the file <a href="../../CONFIG.TXT"><i>CONFIG.TXT</i></a>
 * which resides on the SD-Card.<br>
 *
 * <b>A Note about Time Variables:</b><br>
 * The system clock always starts with <b>standard</b> time, i.e. <b>MEZ</b>.
 * When the @ref DCF77_Atomic_Clock time has been received, and this notifies
 * <b>daylight saving time</b>, i.e. <b>MESZ</b>, all alarm times will be
 * converted to MESZ by adding one hour.  This requires time variables, e.g.
 * @ref UA1_ON_TIME_1 to be set in <b>MEZ</b> time zone, even if MESZ is
 * currently valid.<br>
 *
 * @subsection UA1_ON_TIME_1 UA1_ON_TIME_1~5, UA1_OFF_TIME_1~5
 * These variables determine the on and off times of the UA1 Power Output.
 * If the @ref RFID_Reader uses this output it will also be enabled or disabled.
 *
 * @subsection UA2_ON_TIME_1 UA2_ON_TIME_1~5, UA2_OFF_TIME_1~5
 * These variables determine the on and off times of the UA2 Power Output.
 * If the @ref RFID_Reader uses this output it will also be enabled or disabled.
 *
 * @subsection BATT_ON_TIME_1 BATT_ON_TIME_1~5, BATT_OFF_TIME_1~5
 * These variables determine the on and off times of the BATT Power Output.
 * If the @ref RFID_Reader uses this output it will also be enabled or disabled.
 *
 * @subsection UA1_INTERVAL UA1_INTERVAL and UA1_ON_DURATION
 * These variables allow you to specify a Power Cycle Interval during the ON
 * times of Power Output UA1.  UA1_INTERVAL is the length of the interval in
 * [s], UA1_ON_DURATION the ON duration in [s] during this intervals.
 *
 * @subsection UA2_INTERVAL UA2_INTERVAL and UA2_ON_DURATION
 * These variables allow you to specify a Power Cycle Interval during the ON
 * times of Power Output UA2.  UA2_INTERVAL is the length of the interval in
 * [s], UA2_ON_DURATION the ON duration in [s] during this intervals.
 *
 * @subsection BATT_INTERVAL BATT_INTERVAL and BATT_ON_DURATION
 * These variables allow you to specify a Power Cycle Interval during the ON
 * times of Power Output BATT.  BATT_INTERVAL is the length of the interval in
 * [s], BATT_ON_DURATION the ON duration in [s] during this intervals.
 *
 * @subsection RFID_TYPE
 * Specifies the @ref RFID_Reader type.  Use <b>SR</b> for a Short Range, and
 * <b>LR</b> for a Long Range reader.
 *
 * @subsection RFID_POWER
 * Selects one of the @ref Power_Outputs to be used as power supply for the
 * @ref RFID_Reader.  If this output is switched by an ON or OFF time, the
 * reader will be enabled or disabled also.
 *
 * @subsection RFID_ABSENT_DETECT_TIMEOUT
 * If set to a value greater than 0, the absence of a transponder, i.e. when it
 * cannot be detected (read) anymore for the amount of seconds, will also be
 * logged.  A value of 0 disables the absence detection.  This is useful for
 * "fly thru" designs, e.g. with the Smart Nest Box.
 *
 * @subsection FollowUpTime UA1/UA2/BATT_MEASURE_FOLLOW_UP_TIME
 * Follow-Up times in [s] for which the measurement of the respective power
 * output is still performed.  Additionally, BATT_INP voltage and current is
 * measured via the battery controller.  For the BATT output, only BATT_INP
 * is measured.
 *
 * @subsection U_Min_Diff UA1/UA2/BATT_MEASURE_U_MIN_DIFF
 * Minimum difference in [mV] the value of the measured voltage must change
 * before generating a new log message.  This is a kind of threshold to reduce
 * the amount of log messages.
 *
 * @subsection I_Min_Diff UA1/UA2/BATT_MEASURE_I_MIN_DIFF
 * Minimum difference in [mA] the value of the measured current must change
 * before generating a new log message.  This is a kind of threshold to reduce
 * the amount of log messages.
 *
 * @subsection CALIBRATE_mV UA1/UA2_CALIBRATE_mV
 * Calibration reference voltage for @ref Power_Outputs UA1 and UA2, specified
 * in [mV].
 *
 * @subsection CALIBRATE_mA UA1/UA2_CALIBRATE_mA
 * Calibration reference current for @ref Power_Outputs UA1 and UA2, specified
 * in [mA].
