#                  time), they will automatically converted to MESZ.    #

# Configuration Variables in config.txt:

# RFID_TYPE [SR, LR]
#   RFID reader device type: SR is Short Range reader, LR is Long Range reader.
#   If no type is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.

# RFID_POWER [UA1, UA2, BATT]
#   RFID reader power source, must be set to UA1 or UA2.
#   If no value is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.

# RFID_ABSENT_DETECT_TIMEOUT [s]
#   An RFID reader regularly re-sends the ID, as long as the transponder can be
#   received.  This is used to retrigger a "still present" timer.  The value
#   specifies the time in seconds, after which the transponder is treated as
#   "absent" when its ID could not be received again.
#   A value of 0 disables the absent logic.  This is useful for "fly thru"
#   designs, e.g. with the Smart Nest Box.

# UA1_ON_TIME_1~5, UA1_OFF_TIME_1~5, UA2_ON_TIME_1~5, UA2_OFF_TIME_1~5,
# BATT_ON_TIME_1~5, BATT_OFF_TIME_1~5 [hour:min] MEZ
#   These variables determine the on and off times of the UA1, respective UA2
#   power output.  If an RFID reader is assigned to an output, the UART will be
#   activated additionally.

# UA1_INTERVAL, UA1_ON_DURATION, UA2_INTERVAL, UA2_ON_DURATION, BATT_INTERVAL,
# and BATT_ON_DURATION in [s]
#   These optional variables allow you to define a Power Cycle Interval within
#   the on times of the respective power output.  XXX_INTERVAL specifies the
#   interval in seconds, XXX_ON_DURATION the power ON duration in seconds
#   within this interval.
#   The OFF duration is calculated XXX_INTERVAL minus XXX_ON_DURATION.
#   There exists only one set of values per output.  These are applicable for
#   all five on/off-times.

# UA1_MEASURE_FOLLOW_UP_TIME, UA2_MEASURE_FOLLOW_UP_TIME, and
# BATT_MEASURE_FOLLOW_UP_TIME [s]
#   Duration in [s], the measurement of the respective power output is still
#   performed.  Additionally, BATT_INP voltage and current is measured via
#   the battery controller.  For the BATT output, only BATT_INP is measured.

# SCAN_DURATION [ms]
#   When the ADC has been activated for voltage and current measurements,
#   this variable specifies how long it lasts to measure one channel. There
#   are four ADC channels in use: Voltage and current for UA1 and also for UA2
#   (Battery data is read from its controller).  Within this duration, 2048
#   single measurements are done per channel, which performs the calculation
#   of an average value.  Default value is 1000ms.

# UA1_MEASURE_U_MIN_DIFF, UA1_MEASURE_I_MIN_DIFF, UA2_MEASURE_U_MIN_DIFF [mV],
# and UA2_MEASURE_I_MIN_DIFF [mA]
#   Threshold values for voltage [mV] and current [mA].  No update is done,
#   if values change within this range.  Defaults are 100mV and 10mA.

# UA1_CALIBRATE_mV, UA2_CALIBRATE_mV [mV]
#   Calibration reference voltage for UA1 and UA2, specified in [mV].

# UA1_CALIBRATE_mA, UA2_CALIBRATE_mA [mA]
#   Calibration reference current for UA1 and UA2, specified in [mA].

    # Calibration values for UA1 and UA2 measuring
